# MSBuildShell
Slightly modified version of https://github.com/Cn33liz/MSBuildShell. MSBuildShell, a Powershell Host running within MSBuild.exe. 

## MSBuildShell, a Powershell Host running within MSBuild.exe
This code let's you Bypass Application Whitelisting and Powershell.exe restrictions and gives you a shell that almost looks and feels like a normal Powershell session (Get-Credential, PSSessions -> Works, Tab Completion -> Unfortunately not). It will also bypass the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), which provides enhanced malware protection for Powershell scripts.
